Dear Ghosty,

On behalf of TARGET, please accept our sincere gratitude for your professionalism, transparency, and timely responsible disclosure regarding the critical vulnerability (CVE-2025-55182) you identified on the sub-TARGET.TARGET.com domain on December 10, 2025. Your report, detailing the Remote Code Execution (RCE) flaw, was critical, and we commend your ethical conduct and the quality of your Proof of Concept (PoC). The CVSS 10.0 severity rating reflects the significant risk...

We can confirm that our Incident Response Team (IRT) prioritized this issue as a Critical (Sev 1) security incident. We have isolated and removed the affected infrastructure, closing the specific RCE vulnerability vector you identified.

### 🧪 Request for Research Stand-Down

To ensure environmental integrity and meet requirements, the IRT has moved into a mandatory Containment and Eradication phase, aligned with the NIST SP 800-61 Rev. 2 Framework.

This phase is focused on deep eradication and forensic analysis. Our teams are currently isolating the system and conducting forensics. Analysis has confirmed your PoC.

To maintain the necessary forensic integrity for this critical analysis, we respectfully request that you cease any and all further research, scanning, or testing activity targeting the *.TARGET.com domain, and specifically sub-TARGET.TARGET.com, until we formally confirm the incident is closed. Any external interaction, even benign testing, risks interfering with the crucial evidence capture process required to assure a full recovery.

### 📞 Post-Incident Review and Collaboration Offer

We fully respect your commitment to responsible disclosure and your request for follow-up details. Once the complex Containment, Eradication, and Recovery phases are complete, and we have finalized our Post-Incident Review, we would be pleased to schedule a secure call to share a high-level summary of our findings and remediation steps. We anticipate this will be within the next 10–14 days.

Furthermore, the quality of your disclosure has highlighted opportunities for 3Pillar Global to improve our interaction with the White Hat ethical hacking community. Given your experience operating on platforms like HackerOne, Bugcrowd, and Intigriti, we would be grateful for the opportunity to speak with you directly as a resource. I am committed to institutionalizing a formal Vulnerability Disclosure Policy (VDP) and potentially a Bug Bounty Program (BBP). Your perspective on best practices for scope ...
