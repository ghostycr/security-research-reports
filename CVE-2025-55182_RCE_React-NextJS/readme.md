# Critical RCE Vulnerability Disclosure – CVE-2025-55182
**Target:** https://SUB-TARGET.TARGET.com/  
**Date Discovered:** December 10, 2025  
**Severity:** 💣 Critical (CVSS 10.0)  
**Vulnerability Type:** Remote Code Execution (RCE)  
**Technology Stack:** React Server Components (RSC) + Next.js App Router  
**Status:** Responsibly disclosed | Fixed

---

## 📌 Executive Summary

During a responsible security assessment, I identified a **Remote Code Execution (RCE)** vulnerability on a production domain hosted by TARGET, affecting their Mastercard campaign infrastructure.

This issue correlates with [CVE-2025-55182](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-55182) and allows unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary commands due to flawed trust boundaries in **React Server Components (RSC)** within **Next.js App Router** applications.

---

## 🔍 Technical Analysis

### Root Cause
The flaw stems from insecure processing in the React Flight protocol over the `App Router` in RSC. Untrusted user input reaches server-side execution contexts, enabling command injection.

### RSC Fingerprint Indicators
- `Content-Type: text/x-component`
- `Vary: RSC`
- `window.__next_f` marker
- React Flight body structure

## 💣 Proof of Concept (Ethical)

The following benign commands were executed remotely:

```bash
id
# uid=1001(nextjs) gid=65533(nogroup)

uname -a
# Linux pbc-web-... x86_64 GNU/Linux

ls
# node_modules  package.json  public

whoami
# nextjs
```
## 🧠 Impact

- Arbitrary command execution
- Potential credential leaks (via env)
- File access & persistence
- Lateral movement
- Full server compromis
- Possible PCI/GDPR compliance impact

## 🛡️ Remediation Recommendations
Immediate:

- Disable RSC temporarily
- Block/sanitize RSC payloads at WAF/CDN
- Restrict shell access and egress
- Rotate environment secrets

Long-Term:

- Apply official patch for CVE-2025-55182
- Audit and sanitize RSC serialization logic
